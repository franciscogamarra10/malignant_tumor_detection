# 🔬 Breast Cancer Classification: A Full Machine Learning Workflow

## 1. 📘 Introduction

This project addresses a **binary classification** problem: predicting whether a breast mass is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** using features derived from **fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** tests.

### 🧪 Why FNA?

**Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)** is a minimally invasive and widely used diagnostic procedure to sample cell tissues from a breast mass. The dataset we use includes **30 numerical features** extracted from digitized images of FNA samples. These features describe characteristics such as texture, smoothness, compactness, and other properties of cell nuclei — all relevant indicators for medical diagnosis.This method is a quick and low-risk method to obtain diagnostic information without surgery.Provides quantitative measurements (e.g., nucleus size, texture, concavity) that can be used in automated classification.Often used as a first-line diagnostic tool before biopsy or surgery.

## 2. 📂 Dataset

We use the **`load_breast_cancer`** dataset from `scikit-learn`, originally sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It contains:

- 🧬 **569 samples**
- 📈 **30 numeric features**
- 🎯 **Binary target** (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## 3. 🧭 Project Workflow

This project follows an end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

### 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand feature distributions and correlations with the target.
- Detect class imbalance and assess data quality.

### 🛠️ 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, outliers, and rare categories.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features and apply transformations if needed.

### 🤖 3. Model Building
- Multiple classifiers are tested and compared:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **ExtraTrees**
  - **LightGBM**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

### 🎯 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Two optimization strategies are used:
  - 🔄 `RandomizedSearchCV` – fast, simple, and good for broad exploration.
  - 🧠 `Optuna` – a Bayesian optimization framework with smart trial pruning and adaptive search.

### 📊 5. Model Evaluation & Explanation
- Use metrics like **FNR (False Negative Rate)** to reduce risk in misclassifying malignant cases.
- Apply **SHAP** for feature importance and explainability.
- Optionally use **LIME** for local interpretation.
